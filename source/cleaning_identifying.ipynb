    "In a perfect world, our datasets would all arrive containing only accurate data formatted in exactly the way we need. Sadly, the world we live in is *not* perfect. Either because of clumsy data entry, bad translation between data formats, survey participations trying to be jerks, or the coding errors of other data scientists, messy data is a fact of life. As a result, a key part of being a data scientist is to learn to (a) seek out and identify data cleanliness problems, and (b) learn to correct them. These parts of data science are not nearly as cool or widely discussed as new machine learning packages or the latest learning algorithm, but as anyone who has done data science in the real world will tell you, cleaning (plus merging and reshaping, which we'll cover soon) will take up the *vast* majority of your working life. So in this lesson, we'll talk about tools in `pandas` for identifying and correcting problems with your data!"

    "Everything I said above may sound... well, awful, but here's the good news: once you get into it, data cleaning begins to feel less like grunt work and more like being a detective, and it can actually be a lot of fun. In some of the examples below, I'll be showing you problems in small toy datasets where you can easily see the problems with the data just by looking at the dataset. In real data, however, things aren't so easy -- when your data has hundreds of thousands of rows, or where data errors are subtle, learning to find and isolate problems can actually be quite fun and challenging!
