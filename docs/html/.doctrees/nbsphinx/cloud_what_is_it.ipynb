    "# The Cloud\n",

    "It has become a bit of a trope on the internet to quip \"there is no cloud; it's just somebody else's computer.\" In fact, there are [even stickers to that effect](https://www.redbubble.com/i/sticker/there-is-no-cloud-it-s-just-someone-else-s-computer-by-geekgoods/48737406.EJUG5)! But while it is true that a a big part of the innovation of the cloud is allow you to rent hardware from somebody else without owning it yourself, what makes the cloud The Cloud is not just the ability to rent hardware, but also all the innovations in software that make it possible for (a) lots of computers in a data center to work together in concert, and (b) the resources of a giant data center to be divvied up among lots of separate users seamlessly."

    "## Why the Cloud is Complicated\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps no single innovation has been as central to the rise of the cloud as the software that makes it possible to carve up a single computer into lots of smaller Virtual Machines, each of which acts like a single, normal computer. This technology -- known as virtualization -- it means that if you go to amazon or microsoft and say that you want to rent a computer with 2 processing cores, 16 gigs of ram, and 100 gigabytes of hard drive space, Amazon/Microsoft doesn't have to go find a computer in their data center that has exactly those specifications. Instead, they can find any computer that has at least those resources available, and create a virtual machine on the computer that has access to exactly those resources. To you, this computer looks exactly like a single computer with those resources, but Amazon/Microsoft is free to allocate any other resources on that computer to other people by creating more virtual machines. All of these virtual machines can run on the same physical computer, but all of them are protected from one another, so users can only use exactly what they paid for, and have no way to interact with the other virtual machines on the same computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here's the problem with virtualization: it makes it possible to divide up big computers into little computers, but you can't combine several small computers into one super virtual machine. The reasons for this are a little bit technical, but the basic idea is that when multiple processes are running on the same computer, they can all see and manipulate the same data in memory; but when processes are running on different physical computers, they can only communicate with one another by sending messages across ethernet cables, a process that works very differently and is much much slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, if you want to use 200 processing cores to analyze a huge data set, you can't just request a single virtual machine with 200 cores, because nobody makes a single physical computer with 200 cores. Instead, you will have to rent lots of smaller virtual machine and set them up so that they can interact with each other to share the work using a tool like `dask`."

    "## The Cloud is Not Primarily for Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that's important to understand about the cloud is that most people using it to do the type of work that you all want to do as a data analyst. Most people using the cloud are using it to provide some type of service to internet users. For these people, the role of the cloud is **to serve lots and lots of users, each of whom needs a little bit of processing power and to process a little bit of data.** For example, if you have a messaging app, you'll have lots of people regularly checking for and sending messages, but each of these interactions requires only a tiny amount of processor time, and will only involve moving a tiny amount of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, this time of cloud computing isn't easy -- the really hard part is ensuring that all users can access a common database, so if someone posts a cat picture on Twitter in South Africa, someone in North Carolina can see it when they check their tweet stream. But *most* of the demands can easily be handled by having lots of very small virtual machines, each of which handles a few requests at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "But data analysis is different: instead of lots and lots of users processing small bits of data, **data analysis usually entails a small number of users (often 1) trying to process *tons* of data all at once for a single calculation.** This, unfortunately, makes the fact that we can't use virtualization to create a single giant virtual machine a much, much bigger problem! \n",
    "\n",
    "And that also means you should be aware then when you google around for resources about cloud services, *most* cloud users don't have the same needs you will as a data analyst! So be careful when you pick which internet resources to use for learning about data analysis on the cloud."

    "In the next set of readings and exercises, we'll be learning how -- in a specific sense -- we can setup virtual machines and `dask` clusters on the Microsoft Azure system.

    "The key feature of cloud computing is that you only pay for what you use. If you are planning to actively use a computer 24/7 for years, in many ways it would probably be much cheaper to just buy the computer you want. But most of us only use our computers intermittently, and we only use them really intensely on rare occasions. Given that, it is often much cheaper to pay to rent a couple hundred cores every now and then then to buy a really top-of-the-line desktop computer (plus, you'll probably get your computing done much faster with the couple hundred cords than your desktop!).\n",
