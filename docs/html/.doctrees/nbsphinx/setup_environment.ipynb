    "The first thing we need to do is download the `miniconda` Python package manager. Note this is distinct from the *Anaconda distribution*. The Anaconda distribution comes with a ton of pre-installed packages. That's nice initially, but tends to lead to problems since having all those packages introduces the possibility of package conflicts. So we'll use `miniconda`, which *just* installs Python and the package manager. Then you can add only what you need!\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Python, go to the [miniconda Download page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), download and install the most recent Python 3.x version of miniconda (as of Oct 2020, this was Python 3.8). (On a Mac, the `Pkg` installer is easier to use). \n",

    "In 2000, Python 3 was first released. Python 3 fixed a lot of things people disliked about Python, but in the process it made some changes that meant code written in Python 2 would not work any more. To ease the transition to Python 3, both Python 2 and Python 3 have been supported for several years so people could keep running their Python 2 projects while they finished the transition. Almost everything is now in Python 3, so since you donâ€™t have any old code to worry about, you want Python 3."

    "\n",
    "If you installed Oh-My-Zsh during the command line exercises ([as suggested here](command_line_part1.ipynb), then Anaconda won't work right away. The problem is that when you install Anaconda, it adds some code to the `.bash_profile` file in your user directory. The `.bash_profile` file contains code the is run every time you open a new `bash` command line session (as discussed at the end of [Advanced Command Line](command_line_part2.ipynb)), and the code Anaconda adds adds Anaconda to your `PATH` variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "But Oh-My-Zsh doesn't run the `.bash_profile` file when it opens; it runs the `.zshrc` file. So what we have to do is move the code Anaconda put in `.bash_profile` into `.zshrc`. You can do this as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open `.bash_profile` and copy the block of text  that begin with `# >>> conda init >>>` and ends with `# <<< conda init <<<`.\n",
    "2. Then open `.zshrc`, scroll to the bottom of the file, and past the text you copied from `.bash_profile` into `.zshrc`.\n",
    "3. Save that file, close your current session of Oh-My-Zsh, open it again, and test to see if you were successful by typing `conda -h`. If a conda helpfile gets printed out, you're good!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you copy text from the nano editor (rather than open your file with `atom`) and the nano editor window is narrow, the ends of lines will be truncated when you paste the output (and will end with dollar signs (`$`)).\n",
