    "## Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed in the preceding exercises that sometimes we got access to Azure resources by passing secret keys consisting of a long string of letters and numbers (which I had to load from files so you couldn't see them), and sometimes we ran a code that directed us to visit a webpage and login using our usual Azure logins. That's because Azure (and indeed all cloud platforms) current support a range of authentication methods, some very basic (those secret keys), and some much more sophisticated (the redirect to a web page). Here we'll provide a basic overview of why there are different options, and why you might prefer one of the other. \n",

    "But there are a number of problems with secrets and keys to be aware of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Not personalized:** Suppose that somehow your key gets out -- you inadvertently put it in a public github repo file, or there's some concern that a resource you created wasn't secured. Well, if you now have to cancel that key, it will immediately break *everything* currently using that key! So a small leak results in you having to reset all your resources and networks.  \n",
    "- **Hard to cycle:** Similarly, its good security practice to cycle your keys, meaning that from time to time you change them (just like your password!). But with a hard-coded key, that causes problems because you may have many resources all using a specific key, and if you try to change it you'd have to go to all those services and change the key to keep them working. \n",
    "- **No scope:** With a key, people usually either have the key or they don't, making access binary. You usually can't create a key that gives people read-only access, and a key that gives people edit access, etc. \n",
